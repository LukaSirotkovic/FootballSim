## Running the project

Here are the instructions on how to run the aplication.

### 1. Clone the repository
Opet the terminal and run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/LukaSirotkovic/FootballSim
```

Each terminal has to have a path for its own file. To position yourseft to that file use the following command
```
cd Client
```
```

```
The path should look something like this:
C:\ProgramFiles\MyProjects\SportLeagueSim\Server>

```
npm install
```
Do that for both paths.
